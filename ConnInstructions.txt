LSM6DS33 (gyro and accel.)	1101011b					1101010b
LIS3MDL (magnetometer)		0011110b					0011100b

Adafruit MotorHat 
Install directly on top of Pi.
Assuming at addresses 0x60, 0x70


sudo i2cdetect -y 1
returns
0x60, 0x70, 0x1E, 0x6B
Unplugging just the IMU leaves 0x60 and 0x70
Unplugging the Roboclaws results in no change.

https://learn.adafruit.com/i2c-addresses/the-list
Above site states that the LIS3MDL magnetometer is at 0x1E or 0x1C
and that the LSM6DS33 gyro and accelerometer is at address 0x6A or 0x6B

make sure to have circuitpython installed I guess.
sudo pip install adafruit-circuitpython-motorkit
- done

Made test.py to use adafruit motorKit library. It currently works.
