/*
 * THERE ARE ONLY THREE FILES YOU NEED OUT OF THIS FOLDER.
 * If it says examples, you do not need them.
 * you just need the:
 * packet_serial.cpp
 * READ_ME.cpp
 * Roboclaw.cpp
 * Roboclaw.h
 * That shoud be everything
 *
 * Your packet_serial, I did not convert the commented code into c++ because
 * I just realized they were actual code and not comments until after I did
 * all the converions.
 * If you want, I can convert them too.
 *
 * THIS CODE MAY OR MAY NOT WORK AT FIRST.
 * I am like a somewhat expert at Java, amatuer in c++ and like a novice/rookie
 * in python. So understanding your python code took a while.
 *
 * Also I think you can run an arduino package in pi but I also have a mac OS
 * and cannot really check for that but I found this neat website for windows
 * if you want to try.
 * https://www.deviceplus.com/raspberry-pi/how-to-run-arduino-sketches-on-raspberry-pi/
 * Please check it out.
